# ENGETO_PYTHON_PROJECT_1
Python Academy ENGETO - Project_1: Text analyzer

# ASSIGNMENT
The goal of the project is to create a text analyzer - a program that will be able to sift through a text of any length and find out various information about it.
There can be up to ten thousand such texts, for example.
The program works with three pre-prepared texts, but it will also work with a different number.

# PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:
- At the beginning, the user is asked for a username and password. If the user is not registered, he is notified and the program is terminated.
- The program will analyze one of several pre-prepared texts.
- The user selects a text by numeric designation. If the user enters an invalid text number or enters another input instead of a number, he is notified and the program is terminated.

# TEXT ANALYSIS OUTPUT
- Number of words (a string of characters separated by spaces is counted as a word).
- Number of words starting with a capital letter.
- Number of words written in capital letters.
- Number of words written in lowercase letters.
- Number of numbers (not digits).
- Sum of all numbers (not digits) in the selected text.
- The program displays a simple bar graph that will represent the frequency of different lengths of words in the text.
